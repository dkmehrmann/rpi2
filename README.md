# rpi2

I recently caved and bought a Raspberry Pi to learn Linux networking things like that, so this repository will contain my work related to that. Since I was learning from the bottom up, I thought I would document my process in the form of a tutorial for anybody looking to learn this stuff.

### RPy2 Tutorial

The name is a lame combination of the Raspberry Pi 2's nickname, RPi2, and Python. To my credit, the name was actually a typo that I decided to keep because it was too much trouble to change it. I also wrote this with my brother in mind, who I also purchased an RPi2 for. He has/had zero Linux experience, so the tutorial starts off **very** slow and would be good for somebody who is new to Linux and just wants to hit the ground running. For the same reasons, I gloss over some things and might even make some mistakes since I am learning too. 

### RemoteServer.ipynb

This is just a simple document that outlines how to set up an IPython notebook server to run on the RPi2 that you can access from, say, your laptop. Lesson 3 of the tutorial touches on how to set up a Flask server that you can access from off-network, but I haven't yet combined the two concepts.
