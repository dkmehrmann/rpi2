    "#### Linux and the Command Line\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've got that running lets talk about Linux and the Command Line Interface (CLI) in more detail. Linux is a computer operating system popular among software developers that is completely free and *open-source*. Almost all of the world's supercoputers use Linux in one form or another and it is the leading operating system for servers. Linux is part of the *Unix-like* family of operating systems which includes OS X and Android. Unlike OS X, Linux is open-source, meaning it is run and maintained by a community of people instead of a company. This also means anybody can contribute changes or upgrades to Linux, pending approval by members of the community. Why would anybody want to work on Linux for free? I have no idea, but the system works very well as evidenced by its widespread use by people who, quite frankly, know what they're talking about. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many *distributions* of Linux, including Ubuntu and Raspbian. Ubuntu is the most popular distribution for personal computers, and Raspbian is the one that comes with the RPi2. The two *interfaces* that Raspbian offers are the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the Command Line Interface (CLI). The GUI is what you are used to, with colorful graphics and clickable icons, and it is the one you are looking at now. If you want to know what the CLI looks like, open a Terminal window. That's it. When computers were first invented, this was all they had to work with. GUIs make certain things very convenient, such as browsing the web or drawing a picture. We will see later that the command line is very useful for interfacing with the Linux OS as well as the file system in ways that could not easily be done through the GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a Terminal window and lets go over the fundamentals. You should see something that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pi@raspberrypi ~ $ \n",
    "\n",
    "`pi` is your username and `raspberrypi` is the *hostname*, or the name of the computer you're working on. Read out loud, it makes sense...pi at raspberrypi. $ is the end character, letting you know that it is ready to accept your commands. The thing in the middle, `~`, is your location within the file system. `~` is shorthand for your *home directory*. You can think of this as the place to store all of your *directories* or folders. If you are unsure of which directory you are in, just type \n",
    "\n",
    "    pwd\n",
    "\n",
    "which will show your *present working directory*. Go ahead and type \n",
    "\n",
    "    ls\n",
    "    \n",
    "This will show (or *list*, hence `ls`) the contents of your current directory.  The items in blue are *directories*, and the items in white are *files*. Directories are the same as folders. If you'd like to enter a directory, use the command \n",
    "\n",
    "    cd\n",
    "\n",
    "for *change directory*. Go ahead and try the following commands and try to understand what is going on:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd python_games/\n",
    "    pwd\n",
    "    ls\n",
    "\n",
    "The first command changes the working directory to `python_games`. The second one outputs your present working directory which is `python_games`, since you just moved there. You might notice that it is listed as something like `/home/pi/python_games`. This is the same as `~/python_games`, which makes sense because you started in `~`, then moved from `~` to `python_games`. To be clear, `~` is shorthand for `/home/<user>`, where `<user>` in this case is `pi`. The directory structure is tree-like, so when you move from `~` to `python_games`, this is listed as `~/python_games`. Take a look at the output of `ls`. You might notice that there are some files that end in `.py`. These are some Python programs that come with Raspbian. To list only the Python programs, you can type \n",
    "\n",
    "    ls *.py\n",
    "\n",
    "The `*` character is a *wildcard*, which will act as any character or combination of characters. Therefore, `ls *.py` lists all files that end in `.py`. You might have noticed from the name of the directory that these files are actually simple games written in the Python programming language. We will learn how to run these files in a future section, but for now we're just exploring. To examine the contents of one of the python files, you can type \n",
    "\n",
    "    cat <filename>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Try `cat flippy.py`. Everything that the Terminal spit out after you typed that command is the contents of the file `flippy.py`. This is what Python programs look like. If that is too much to read at once, just type \n",
    "\n",
    "    more flippy.py\n",
    "    \n",
    "This will start at the beginning and show you a new line each time you press Enter. If you don't feel like reading the whole file, simply press CTRL+C to get back to a fresh prompt. CTRL+C is the way to escape from commands you've entered. Some commands, like `top`, will run indefinitely until you tell it to stop. Go ahead and enter `top`, which will print out system information on CPU usage, memory usage, and which processes are running. To get back to a fresh prompt, use CTRL+C to exit the `top` program.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can enter the command \n",
    "\n",
    "    cd ..\n",
    "    \n",
    "when you are done looking around the `python_programs` directory. This changes the working directory from the current one to one level up. This means we will move from `/home/pi/python_games` to `/home/pi`, or `~`. This is a common method of \"backing up\" when exploring the Linux file system. Try moving around the file system, exploring directories, and examining the contents of files. Being comfortable navigating the file system is crucial to working with Linux from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IPython Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The document you are looking at is called an IPython Notebook or Jupyter Notebook. The file extension `.ipynb` comes from this fact. Recently, the IPython Notebook project has been overtaken by The Jupyter project, which results in the confusion. Whatever you call it, it is a powerful and popular *Interactive Development Environment* or IDE used mainly for the *Python* programming language. Confused yet? That's OK, we'll talk about all of that in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Python\n",
    "Python is a high-level programming language, meaning it is easier to read and write than something like C or C++. High-level languages are great for learning, but have performance disadvantages. That's why most of the underlying code in a computer is written in low-level languages. Nevertheless, Python can be used for lots of applications where speed and efficiency aren't really a concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python programs come in the form of scripts, which are simply text files with the file extension `.py`. If I had a program called `test.py`, I'd run it by typing\n",
    "\n",
    "    python test.py\n",
    "\n",
    "in the command line. Try navigating to the directory `~/python_games`. Once inside, run `ls *.py` to view all the python files. Choose one you'd like to try, and type\n",
    "\n",
    "    python <filename>.py\n",
    "    \n",
    "which will launch the game of your choice. For example, if you wanted to play a game called flippy, you would type `python flippy.py`. Once you get comfortable with Python, you will by able to edit the code files to make changes to these games and see your modifications come to life.\n",
    "\n",
    "One unfortunate reality of programming is that significant time will be spend *debugging*, or fixing mistakes in the code. Mistakes come in two basic forms, syntax and runtime. Syntax errors occur when you type something in the wrong format. Think forgetting a space or putting a decimal in the wrong place. Runtime errors occur when the code instructs the computer to do something it is unable to do. Think dividing by zero. If a write a Python script that has a mistake in it, either syntactical or runtime, I would have to open up the text file and edit the code within, then rerun the entire program in order to debug. If my program was 1000 lines long and took an hour to run, you can imagine my frustration if I forgot a bracket `]` on line 965 and had to spend another hour running it. IPython is a great way for avoiding those kinds of frustrations and a great tool for learning Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### IPython\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython is short for *Interactive Python* and allows you to run one line of code at a time. You can take it for a test drive by typing \n",
    "\n",
    "    ipython\n",
    "\n",
    "into the command line. You may get a message saying something to the effect of ipython not being installed. This is where Linux shines, because installing ipython couldn't be easier. To get ipython, you can simply type \n",
    "\n",
    "    sudo apt-get ipython\n",
    "\n",
    "and wait for it to finish downloading an installing. That's it. And since Python is *open source*, virtually every add-on or spin-off will be totally free. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now try typing `ipython` and you should get something that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    In [1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "Try typing a simple python command, like `2+2`. Notice that `In` is for input and `Out` is for the output that Python provides. Try something more complicated like\n",
    "\n",
    "    In [2]: a = [1,2,3]\n",
    "    In [3]: a\n",
    "\n",
    "`In [2]` shows how to *assign* (`=`) some *object* (`[1,2,3]`) to a *variable* (`a`). `In [3]`, simply issues the name of the variable to print the object to `Out`. We'll go into details on what all of that means later, but for now we'll just try things out and play with the IPython interpreter. The only way to learn to program is to try things, get errors, figure out why, and adjust your method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Try `a*2`. You'll notice that you didn't get the output you'd expect. Instead of multiplying each element of `a` by 2, it thought you wanted `a` twice! Now try `a+2`. Oops! Our first error. You'll notice that some error information is printed out that may or may not be helpful in identifying what has gone wrong. Try some other manipulations of the `a` object, like\n",
    "\n",
    "    type(a)\n",
    "    \n",
    "which will tell you the type of object it is\n",
    "\n",
    "    len(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "which will tell you the length of the list\n",
    "\n",
    "    sum(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "which will add all the elements of a. `type`, `len`, and `sum` are called *functions*. They perform some operation on the object inside parentheses (). To get more information about the `sum()` function, you can type \n",
    "\n",
    "    ?sum()\n",
    "    \n",
    "into IPython. Functions always have parentheses after them and the things that go inside the parentheses are called *arguments* of the function. In these simple examples, the only argument we passed to each function was the object `a` which we know to be a list including 1, 2, and 3. To access the first element of the list, you can call it by *index*, or by its location within the list. Try typing\n",
    "\n",
    "    a[0]\n",
    "    \n",
    "Two important things to note here:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collections of items can sometimes be called by *index*, or their position in the collection. In this case, `a` is a list, and we want a single element from it. The way to do that is to type `a[index of element]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Python is *indexed at zero*, meaning the first items of a collection of items corresponds to the 0 position. For example, to access the first element of `a`, we call it by `a[0]`. To access the second element, we type `a[1]`, and so on. This peculiarity is common to many languages, and has several advantages that won't be discussed here. Simply know that to access the *n*th element of a collection, you actually need to reference the *n-1*th index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to access different elements of `a`. `a[1]` works, `a[2]` works, but `a[3]` throws an error. In this case, the error message is very helpful, and even explicitly states what you did wrong. Even though `a` is 3 elements long, since Python indexes things at 0, the index value 3 references the 4th element in the list, which doesn't exist! You can also *slice* the list, by specifying a range of index values with a colon :. Try\n",
    "\n",
    "    a[1:3]\n",
    "    \n",
    "This will give you everything after the first element and including the third element (the second and third elements). It is important to note that 1, 2, and 3 are special in the fact that they are numbers. Python knows that, and you can check for yourself what Python thinks about the first entry in the list by typing\n",
    "\n",
    "    type(a[0])\n",
    "    \n",
    "This is a chained command, because you are calling a value of the list `a` within the function `type()`. This is allowed in Python and is indeed common. Notice that the output shows `int`, which is short for integer. If you paid attention in math class, you know that this is appropriate for the number 1, which is what a[0] is. Since index calls are integers, and the values of the list `a` are integers, we run the risk of getting confused. Lets define another list, `b`, like this\n",
    "\n",
    "    b = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\n",
    "    \n",
    "The apostrophe characters may be tedious to type, but they are important. They indicate that everything between each apostrophe is a *string*. Strings are things that aren't numbers such as letters or words. Notice that if we run \n",
    "\n",
    "    sum(b)\n",
    "    \n",
    "we'll get an error. In this case, the error message doesn't really make sense. Nevertheless we know that taking the sum of the letters a-d doesn't make any sense, and therefore can't be done. This is an example of a runtime error. A syntax error might occur if we type \n",
    "\n",
    "    sum(b.)\n",
    "\n",
    "and in fact Python lets us know that we made a syntax error. Check what type one of the elements of the list are using the `type` function and indexing. You should discover that each element is an object of type `str` for string. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't exited out of your IPython session since you've created both the `a` and `b` objects, they should both still be there. Try typing \n",
    "\n",
    "    whos\n",
    "    \n",
    "This will give you a listing of all defined variables from the current IPython session. You should see `a` and `b` there, as well as some information about them. Even though we haven't worked with `a` in a while, it is still around. You can see this by typing `a`. Try making some Python objects. Some examples are\n",
    "\n",
    "    c = 2\n",
    "    d = 12.3\n",
    "    e = \"raspberry\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Check their type. Try `c+d`. Try `a.append(c)`. Try `a.append(e)`. Examine `a` after *appending*, or adding, the other objects to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "One more note about functions. Remember how the things inside the parentheses are called arguments? Many functions take multiple arguments, and it can get complicated to keep them straight. That is why it is always good to view the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html) on the built-in functions you want to use. Lets look at the function `sorted()`. It takes an object and sorts it in ascending order. Try\n",
    "\n",
    "    sorted(a)\n",
    "    \n",
    "This will return a copy of the `a` object sorted in ascending order. Suppose we wanted to sort in descending order. The `sorted()` function takes an *optional argument*, which means that is doesn't have to be passed, called `reverse`. This optional argument defaults to **False**, meaning it will sort in ascending order if the argument is not passed. If we want to sort in descending or reverse order, we can type\n",
    "\n",
    "    sorted(a, reverse=True)\n",
    "    \n",
    "which will return a copy of `a` which has been sorted in reverse order. If we want to store that sorted list, we can type \n",
    "\n",
    "    a_rev = sorted(a, reverse=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "which will store the sorted list in a new object called `a_rev`. You can call the new object anything you want, I just chose the name `a_rev` arbitrarily. Try typing `whos` now, and you will see all the new objects we've created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To get out of IPython, type exit()."
